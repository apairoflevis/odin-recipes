# odin-recipes
First true project for TOP

This is the first project I will have started in a couple of years. I burned out on web development and have regretted the decision since that point in time. I am now focused on web development once more to better my life.

This project is a simple project for The Odin Project and is probably the building block for learning html and will probably revisit this project again to add CSS and JS functionality. 

This current iteration of the project is focused on creating the html structure for a basic recipe site.
