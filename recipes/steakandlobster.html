    <h3>A delicious yet decadent dinner for the hard-working developer.</h3>
    <p>After a long day of coding and working on the Odin Project, don't you think you deserve a satisfying meal fit for a future 1%er?</p>
    <P>This meal is brought to you by only the finest grass-fed, free-range, non-GMO cows in America and the lobsters are flown in from the decadent beaches of the North East. Rest assured,
        these lobsters are definitely not from the tanks of your local Red Lobster.
    </P>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
           <li>2 rib eye steaks around 14 ounces total, or 1 cut in half</li>
           <li>2 lobster tails, around 4 ounces each</li>
           <li>½ cup (1 stick) butter, softened</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
           <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon salt and pepper</li> 
        </ul>
    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Rinse lobster tails, pat dry and place on a baking sheet. Pat steak dry and season with a teaspoon salt and pepper. Set aside</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine butter, lemon juice, garlic powder and parsley. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Using shears, cut the lobster shells down the center to the base, stopping before cutting through the base. Using a spoon, separate the lobster from the shell.</li>
            <li>Open up the shell a little bit, grab the meat and pull it up and over the shell, squeezing the shell back together and letting the meat rest on top of the seam. Make a shallow cut along the center of the meat and layer it over the sides of the shell.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the compound butter. Brush the lobster meat with the butter.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium, oven safe skillet over medium high heat. Add steaks to the skillet and sear for 2 minutes on each side. Place the steaks in the oven and cook for 4-5 minutes for rare to medium rare. Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>As soon as you start searing the steaks, put the lobsters in the oven on a middle rack. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until lobster is firm and opaque but not rubbery.</li>
            <li>Top both the steak and lobster with slabs of the compound butter. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
